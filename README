The opsplorer script is intended to be an alternative to the file-explorer
plugin that comes with the vim package. It's got a tree structure (you can
also quickly change the tree root path) and is designed to be as compact as
possible.

For detailed description, see :help opsplorer.txt

Have fun :-)
